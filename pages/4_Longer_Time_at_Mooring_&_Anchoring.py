    â€¢ Above graph depicts the Mooring pattern of the vessels which took more than 
      42 hours to moor for APMT & Non APMT terminals & Green line represents the

Observations:-
    â€¢ APMT performed slightly better than Non APMT & best in the month of January

Observations:-
    â€¢ Non APMT Performed better than APMT but in January APMT outperformed Non APMT,
